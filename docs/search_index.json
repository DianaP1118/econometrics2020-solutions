For the full dataset always refer to the data source! The dataset linton is an adapted version of the data Linton et al. (2020) use to study the incubation period of SARS-CoV-19, the virus that causes COVID19. It contains 114 observations on COVID19 patients, mainly from mainland China. For this homework we are only interested in the variable Incubation that measures the time in days from exposure to the virus to symptoms onset. Before you begin you may find the following source useful: Simple regression model: Heumann and Shalabh (2016), pp. 249-259. Hypothesis testing: Heumann and Shalabh (2016), pp. 219-221. Confidence interval: Heumann and Shalabh (2016), pp. 197-199. Normal distribution: Heumann and Shalabh (2016), pp. 166-169. Read and download the data (already done in the starter code) Let \\(y_i\\) denote the incubation time for patient \\(i = 1,\\ldots,n\\). Let \\(u_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma ^ 2)\\) be a normally distributed random variable with zero mean and variance \\(\\sigma ^ 2\\). Furthermore, assume that the error terms \\(u_i\\) are independent. Fit the linear regression model: \\[\\begin{align} y_i = \\beta_0 + u_i, \\quad i = 1,\\ldots,n. \\tag{2.1} \\end{align}\\] Hint: use the lm function in R. fit &lt;- lm(Incubation ~ 1, data = linton) ## This instructs lm to use only a constant Print the summary of the regression fit summary(fit) Write down the estimated regression equation (as a comment in the code). What is the meaning of the intercept \\(\\beta_0\\) in the model? Write your answer in plain language as a comment in the code. Estimate a 95 percent confidence interval for \\(\\beta_0\\). Given the hypothesis: \\[\\begin{align} H_0: \\beta_0 = 8 \\tag{2.2}\\\\ H_1: \\beta_0 \\neq 8 \\tag{2.3} \\end{align}\\] Explain the meaning of (2.2) in plain language. Using the regression output, test the hypothesis at a 5 percent significance level and write down your decision to reject or not to reject the null hypothesis. Using the regression output, estimate the probability that a randomly chosen person will have an incubation period between 5 and 10 days. Do you see any problems with the choice of the statistical model in (2.1) (write down your answer as a comment in the code)? "]
