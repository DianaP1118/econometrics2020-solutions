## Homework 2

Github classroom link: [https://classroom.github.com/g/qogtEQ5b](https://classroom.github.com/g/qogtEQ5b)

**Disclaimer**: As in the previous homework, please note that the dataset used here is simplified for _ease of use_ and the analysis here
MUST be viewed an an exercise, not real-world research! For the full dataset always refer to the data source!

The dataset `linton` is an adapted version of the data  @Linton2020 use to study the incubation period of SARS-CoV-19, the virus that causes COVID19. It contains 114 observations on COVID19 patients, mainly from mainland China. For this homework we are only interested in the variable `Incubation`  
that measures the time in days from exposure to the virus to symptoms onset.

Before you begin you may find the following source useful:

- Simple regression model: @Heumann2016, pp. 249-259.
- Hypothesis testing: @Heumann2016, pp. 219-221.
- Confidence interval: @Heumann2016, pp. 197-199.
- Normal distribution: @Heumann2016, pp. 166-169.

1. Read and download the data (already done in the starter code)

2. Let $y_i$ denote the incubation time for patient $i = 1,\ldots,n$. Let $u_i \sim N(0, \sigma ^ 2)$ be a normally distributed random variable with zero mean and variance $\sigma ^ 2$. Furthermore, assume that the error terms $u_i$ are independent. Fit the linear regression model:

\begin{align}
  y_i = \beta_0 + u_i, \quad i = 1,\ldots,n. (\#eq:hw1-regression-model)
\end{align}

_Hint_: use the `lm` function in R.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
  fit <- lm(Incubation ~ 1, data = linton) ## This instructs lm to use only a constant
```

2. Print the summary of the regression fit

```{r, eval=FALSE}
  summary(fit)
```

3. Write down the estimated regression equation (as a comment in the code).

4. What is the meaning of the intercept $\beta_0$ in the model? Write your answer in plain language as a comment in the code.

5. Estimate a 95 percent confidence interval for $\beta_0$.

6. Given the hypothesis:

\begin{align}
  H_0: \beta_0 = 8 (\#eq:hw2-null-hypothesis)\\
  H_1: \beta_0 \neq 8 (\#eq:hw2-alternative-hypothesis)
\end{align}

  - Explain the meaning of \@ref(eq:hw2-null-hypothesis) in plain language.
  - Using the regression output, test the hypothesis at a 5 percent significance level and write down your decision to
    reject or not to reject the null hypothesis.
    
7. Using the regression output, estimate the probability that a randomly chosen person will have an incubation period
  between 5 and 10 days.

8. Do you see any problems with the choice of the statistical model in \@ref(eq:hw1-regression-model) (write down your answer as a comment in the code)?
